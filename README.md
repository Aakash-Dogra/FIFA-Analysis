“*Visualization is really about external cognition, that is, how resources outside the mind can be used to boost the cognitive capabilities of the mind.*”

**— Stuart Card**

The quote truly shows what a visualization can do to an individual’s sense of understanding of a subject. This article does not signify the importance of visualization, but it’s an attempt to convey my story of how I worked my way through a data set and tried to visualize my idea of how I see the data.

Before we set out to the see the different visualizations and illustrations of the data, we will understand the importance of visualization. It is often regarded as a skill that is taught to every entry-level data enthusiast, but in reality, it is something that is mastered only by a few! Data visualization, in general, is a pictorial or visual representation of data for making the number visually appealing. Or if we have to say this in the simplest manner, it is like giving kids a book with pictures to catch their attention!

In this article, I have tried to portray my skills with data manipulation, analysing, cleaning and visualization with something I love the most: Football. To my readers in the United States, Football here refers to the actual game where the ball is kicked by foot, hence the name football. This dataset is actual ratings and stats of players all around the world who are involved in the digital game of FIFA, developed by EA. This game is played by millions all around the world and is something enjoyed by every gamer around the globe. I will try to visualize the stats that we generally see during the post-game talk, like the best players around the world, in terms of their attributes and value. Also, I would provide some suggestions, based on my analysis of the dataset. I hope you enjoy this visual journey and learn a few things on the way!

The data set consists of data of all the players around the world, their personal stats and their career information. The data is read using pandas library. The dataset looks like follows:
